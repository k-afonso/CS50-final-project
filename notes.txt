Tables
    transaction: on the type it can be listed, borrowed, removed.

Item images:
    I really wanted to create a way for users to upload images using input type=file, then I would
    take the image and store it locally or on a sql table. It turns out that this is way more complicated
    then I thougth. This is something that I will might add in the future once I feel more comfortable.
    For now, I will still use a sql db to store each image path.


Cool things to add:
    - Sort listed items by category (Garden, construction, cleaning, etc.)
    - Add collect and return date. This way you can tell when the item will be available again
